##### Issues :

1. Nothing happens: Verify the bot has permissions in the target server. If not, you know why it doesn't work

2. Got an error when login client: Did you changed the token bythe bot's token ?

3. Got some errors when trying to executing functions: Did you changed the server ID etc... by the real values ?

##### Thank you !

Thank you to use our application and have trust in us ! Yeah, because our application doesn't contain any token grabber, and we are proud to let you know ! üôÇ ‚ù§
